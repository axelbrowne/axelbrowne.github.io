        <p className="abt-body">
          I am a software developer from Santa Fe, NM. This year, I will be 
          in my fourth year studying computer science at Loyola Marymount University 
          in Los Angeles, CA.
          <br/><br/>
          At LMU, I have continued to pursue my passion for programming
          that began with creating agent-based models of ecosystems.
          My programming interests have grown to include data science and AI.
          <br/><br/>
          When I'm not writing code, I love to listen to <a className="intext-link" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1279758953?si=2he-hlfXROK33CZ-xjgbDA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            music 
          </a> and audiobooks, play basketball, eat almond butter, and enjoy the outdoors.
          <br/><br/>
          Thanks for stopping by! :)
