            I am a software developer from Santa Fe, NM in my fourth year studying 
            computer science at Loyola Marymount University 
            in Los Angeles, CA.
            <br/><br/>
            At LMU, I have continued to pursue my passion for programming
            that began with creating agent-based models of ecosystems.
            My programming interests have grown to include data science and AI.
            <br/><br/>
            When I'm not writing code, I love to listen to <a className="intext-link" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1279758953?si=2he-hlfXROK33CZ-xjgbDA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              music 
            </a> and audiobooks, play basketball, eat almond butter, and enjoy the outdoors.
            <br/><br/>
            Thanks for stopping by! :)
